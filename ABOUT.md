Khadijah Shtayat
================
I have around 7 year in web development 4 of them in PHP specially Yii framework and because there is no enough time to learn new language and deliver the assignment  on time used choose PHP as Language. In additional yii2 framework Yii is a secure, fast, high-performance application/web-development framework.


what you wanted to accomplish?
------------------------------
Create basic Hotel Deal search and give the flexibility to change and validate search parameters.

What I learn new?
-----------------
Most time spend trying to fix the UI (and its still not fixed) but I learn more about css class and bootstrap + query UI plugins

Something I wish I Do:
----------------------
1. Test project in Travis-CI
2. Retrieve data by selected currency
3. Ability to select  language
4. Min/Max Pricing Filter
5. Google map to make search location easier
6. Recommend Hotel based on last user search
7. Sorting by result  top deal/rating/pricing/
8. There is 3 type of "productType" [Hotel,Flight,Package] I can create filter based on each type

somethings I couldn't find :
----------------------

1. Result pre request should be configurable. Current always max-total number of result is 50 . Total reuslt per page should be configurable
2. page attribute on request is require but I think is not working.
3. I don’t use “Length of Stay” attribute on my search page because it need to woke in validation to ensure not sending both min/maxTripStartDate & lengthOfStay
4. JS/CSS need to minify in order to reduce load page time .
5. API documentation was required like this (https://hackathon.expedia.com/docs/public/api/)
